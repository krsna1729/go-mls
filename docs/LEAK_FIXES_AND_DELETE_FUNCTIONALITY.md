# Goroutine Leak Fixes and Delete Functionality Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the Go-MLS streaming application to eliminate goroutine leaks, provide detailed resource monitoring, and add graceful delete functionality. The implementation ensures all application-created goroutines exit cleanly on shutdown while maintaining proper resource tracking.

## Goroutine Leak Fixes and Resource Monitoring

### 1. Comprehensive Shutdown Sequence

**Problem**: Multiple goroutines (relay monitors, directory watchers, SSE handlers) could leak on application shutdown.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented structured shutdown sequence with proper ordering
- Added detailed goroutine leak analysis using runtime stack traces
- Enhanced resource usage reporting with memory and system statistics
- Ensured all application goroutines are tracked and terminated

**Files Modified**:
- `main.go` - Shutdown orchestration and resource monitoring
- `internal/stream/recording_manager.go` - Directory watcher and SSE shutdown
- `internal/stream/input_relay_manager.go` - Relay goroutine management
- `internal/stream/output_relay_manager.go` - Relay goroutine management

### 2. Advanced Goroutine Leak Detection

**Problem**: Difficult to distinguish between system and application goroutines for accurate leak detection.

**Solution**:
- Implemented runtime stack trace analysis to categorize goroutines
- Added pattern matching to identify system vs application goroutines  
- Provided detailed stack trace summaries for leak investigation
- Created comprehensive goroutine profiling with execution counts

**Key Features**:
- Stack trace parsing and analysis
- System pattern recognition (runtime, GC, signal handlers)
- Application goroutine identification and tracking
- Detailed leak reporting with stack traces

### 3. Directory Watcher and SSE Handler Shutdown

**Problem**: Directory watcher and Server-Sent Event handlers could continue running after shutdown.

**Solution**:
- Refactored `watchRecordingsDir` to be context-aware and cleanly exit
- Added `Shutdown` method to `RecordingManager` for proper cleanup
- Implemented SSE broker shutdown to close all active connections
- Used `sync.WaitGroup` to track and wait for goroutine completion

### 4. Context-Based Goroutine Lifecycle Management

**Problem**: The `monitorFFmpegProgress` goroutines could potentially run indefinitely if the parent process exits unexpectedly.

**Solution**: 
- Added `context.Context` and `context.CancelFunc` to both `InputRelay` and `OutputRelay` structs
- Added `sync.WaitGroup` to track all goroutines launched per relay
- Modified monitoring functions to respect context cancellation
- Enhanced signal handling with proper SIGTERM followed by SIGKILL fallback

## Delete Functionality

### 1. Backend API Endpoints

**New Endpoints**:
- `/api/relay/delete-input` - Deletes an entire input and all associated outputs
- `/api/relay/delete-output` - Deletes a single output

**Implementation**:
- `DeleteInput()` method: Removes input relay and all associated outputs forcefully
- `DeleteOutput()` method: Removes single output and decrements input reference count
- Proper error handling and logging

### 2. Frontend UI Enhancements

**Delete Buttons**:
- Added delete icons (trash can) for both inputs and outputs in the relay table
- Input delete button: Deletes the entire input and all its outputs
- Output delete button: Deletes only the specific output

**UI Features**:
- Confirmation dialogs to prevent accidental deletions
- Icon-only buttons for clean UI
- Error handling with user feedback
- Responsive design maintained

### 3. Table Structure Updates

**Table Layout**:
- Added "Delete" column for inputs
- Modified action column to include delete buttons for outputs
- Maintained responsive design with proper column headers

## Technical Implementation Details

### Shutdown Sequence Pattern

```go
// 1. Signal handling setup
go func() {
    <-sigChan
    logger.Info("Received interrupt signal, initiating graceful shutdown...")
    
    // 2. HTTP server shutdown (30s timeout)
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 30*time.Second)
    defer cancel()
    server.Shutdown(ctx)
    
    // 3. Stop all active relays
    relayManager.StopAllRelays()
    
    // 4. Stop recordings and directory watcher
    recordingManager.Shutdown()
    
    // 5. Stop RTSP server
    rtspServer.Close()
    
    // 6. Final cleanup wait
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
    
    // 7. Resource usage and leak analysis
    printResourceUsage(logger, initialGoroutines)
    
    os.Exit(0)
}()
```

### Goroutine Leak Analysis Pattern

```go
func dumpGoroutineProfiles(logger *Logger) {
    buf := make([]byte, 1<<16)
    stackSize := runtime.Stack(buf, true)
    stackTrace := string(buf[:stackSize])
    
    // Parse and analyze goroutines
    goroutines := parseGoroutineStacks(stackTrace)
    
    systemCount := 0
    appCount := 0
    
    for _, gr := range goroutines {
        if isSystemGoroutine(gr.Function) {
            systemCount++
        } else {
            appCount++
            // Log application goroutines for investigation
            logger.Warn("Application goroutine: %s", gr.Function)
        }
    }
    
    logger.Info("Goroutine Analysis:")
    logger.Info("  System: %d", systemCount)
    logger.Info("  Application: %d", appCount)
}
```

### Recording Manager Shutdown Pattern

```go
func (rm *RecordingManager) Shutdown() {
    rm.logger.Info("Shutting down RecordingManager...")
    
    // Stop all active recordings
    rm.StopAllRecordings()
    
    // Shutdown SSE broker
    sseBroker.Shutdown()
    
    // Cancel directory watcher context
    if rm.cancel != nil {
        rm.cancel()
    }
    
    // Wait for directory watcher to exit
    rm.wg.Wait()
    
    rm.logger.Info("RecordingManager shutdown complete")
}
```

### Directory Watcher Context Pattern

```go
func (rm *RecordingManager) watchRecordingsDir() {
    defer rm.wg.Done()
    
    watcher, err := fsnotify.NewWatcher()
    if err != nil {
        rm.logger.Error("Failed to create directory watcher: %v", err)
        return
    }
    defer watcher.Close()
    
    for {
        select {
        case <-rm.ctx.Done():
            rm.logger.Info("Directory watcher stopping due to context cancellation")
            return
        case event, ok := <-watcher.Events:
            if !ok {
                return
            }
            // Process events...
        case err, ok := <-watcher.Errors:
            if !ok {
                return
            }
            // Handle errors...
        }
    }
}
```

### Delete API Pattern

```go
func apiDeleteInput(relayMgr *stream.RelayManager) http.HandlerFunc {
    return func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        // Parse request
        // Validate input
        // Call delete method
        // Return appropriate response
    }
}
```

## Graceful Shutdown and Resource Monitoring

### Enhanced Signal Handling
The application implements comprehensive signal handling for graceful shutdown:
- **Signal Capture**: SIGINT and SIGTERM handled in dedicated goroutine
- **Ordered Shutdown**: HTTP server → Relays → Recordings → RTSP server
- **Timeout Management**: 30-second timeout for HTTP server shutdown
- **Final Cleanup**: 2-second wait for final goroutine cleanup before reporting

### Advanced Resource Monitoring
Comprehensive resource analysis is performed on application exit:

**Goroutine Analysis**:
- Initial vs final goroutine count comparison
- Runtime stack trace analysis for leak detection
- System vs application goroutine categorization
- Detailed stack trace logging for investigation

**Memory Statistics**:
- Allocated memory and total allocations
- System memory usage and heap object count
- Garbage collection cycle information
- Memory efficiency metrics

**System Information**:
- CPU core count and Go runtime version
- Operating system and architecture details
- Runtime environment configuration

### Goroutine Leak Detection System

**System Goroutine Patterns** (Excluded from leak detection):
- `runtime.main` - Main goroutine
- `runtime.goexit` - Goroutine exit handler
- `runtime/pprof` - Profiling system
- `os/signal.signal_recv` - Signal handler
- `runtime.gc` - Garbage collector
- `runtime.bgsweep` - Background sweeper
- `runtime.bgscavenge` - Background scavenger

**Application Goroutines** (Monitored for leaks):
- Directory watcher (`watchRecordingsDir`)
- SSE handlers (`ApiRecordingsSSE`)
- Relay monitors (`monitorFFmpegProgress`)
- Custom application logic

### Shutdown Verification Process
1. **Pre-shutdown Count**: Record initial goroutine count
2. **Graceful Termination**: Execute ordered shutdown sequence
3. **Final Analysis**: Compare final goroutine count with baseline
4. **Leak Investigation**: Analyze remaining application goroutines
5. **Resource Report**: Generate comprehensive usage statistics
